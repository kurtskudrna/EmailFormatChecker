# Email Format Checker
This project is a Email Format Check which will take the a few constraints listed in the program and check if you are putting in a email in the right format.
## Motivation
I wanted to create this project because it would be my first using regex in Python and felt that 
checking a password using regex could be something I do in future projects.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [Python]


## How to use?
Run the program and put in a email address in the prompt. The program will let you know whether that is an acceptable email or not.
